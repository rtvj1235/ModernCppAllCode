A system where following is possible
    - create a container of integers. Containers should not have a fixed size
    - Ability to find
        - Min number
        - Max number
        - Total numbers of elements in the container at the moment.
        - Adding numbers
        - removing numbers
    - All elements of my container use heap memory (free pool)
    - Zero Memory Leaks
    - Each of functionalities should be independently callable
    - Program should be written with best practices (for easy maintenance)


    step 1 - Understand problem statement froma top level 

    step 2 - Identify data models required (clases to be created)
    
    step 3 - For every calss to be created repeat the following steps 
             3A] Identify the data members of the class
             3B] Indentify the special member function (constructor , destructor, etc)
             3C] Identify any user any defined functionalities to be added to the class
    
    step 4 - Identify all functionalities to be added to the system (excluding member function)

    step 5 - For every functionalities repeat the following steps
             5a) identify inputs of the function
             5b) Identify the output from the function
             5c) Identify special modifies for the function
             5d) Visualize the solution to be dsigned and write the function
