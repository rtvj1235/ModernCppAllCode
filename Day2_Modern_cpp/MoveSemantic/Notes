/*
    Non - Abstract Type Employee
    Manager Extends employee or Manger derives from employee

    Employee:
        CalculateTax():
            10 % of salary

        V table contains the most derived implementaion of 

        Base class
        Non virtual 1
        [0x100H]
        Non - Virtual 2
        [0x100H]


        If you are upcasting (parent type pointer child type objects)
        -----------------------------------------------------------------

        Rule 1 - for a non virtual function : NO MATTER WHAT IS THE TYPE OF OBJECT
        ALWAYS THE BASE CLASS FUNCTION WILL BE CALLED

        Rule 2 0 For a virtual function ( marked as virtual in base): COMPILER WILL CLL THE
        MOST DERIVED VERSION OF THE FUNCTION i,e IT WILL LOOK IN THE HILD FOR AN OVERRIDEN 
        VERSION OF THE FUNCTION  (Type of object Matters)
