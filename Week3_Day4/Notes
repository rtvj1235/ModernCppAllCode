4 core CPU
1 core can execute 1 process at a time

In one core : we can THEORETICALLY EXECUTE 2 threads CONCURRENTLY!
    Meaning :
    If one thread is facing a delay (I/O delay or cpu delay)
    some other thread of the same process can be switched into

TO DO FASTER EXECUTION,
    - either we need to utilize multiple core (execution of multiple threads
    parallely by runing one thread per core)
    - If multiple cores are not availabe threads can still help but only if 
    there is delay in your program beacause thread can switch when delay happen
