Important notes on object oriented programming

what is OOPS in real->
1. there should be a way for me to create a template a model or something that i want to make
2. THere should be  a way for me to create data units for a model i create
3. way for data units to send data to each other and communicate with each other

Principles 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Encapsulation :
    Data values and operation to be perform on the data ares strored together
    in some model
How to achieve : create data members & functions inside a class

Abstraction :
    Design solutions by indication common behaviour and hiding implementation details for each type demonstrating
    the behaviour
How to achieve: Create Abstract base class or interface 

Inheritance:
    Generlization and specialization 
How to achieve: Apply single, multiple, multi-level , hybrid inheritance pattern


Polymorphism: More than one way of doing something e.g for example writing one or more constructor then we can have more than one ways to 
    create an object or function overloading

How to achieve:
    Run- time or compile time polymorphism using either 
        -Method/ Function overriding
        -Method overloading
        -Meta Programming

Class Vehicle-

        - vehicleId
        - vehicleBrand
        - VehiclePrice

        - Default Constructor disabled
        - Copy constructor enaabled
        - Parametrized constructor with all members enabled
        - Abillity to calculate Tax for the car as 10$ of price

    Car-

        - carModel
        - carType , SEDAN or SOPORTS
        - copy constructor enabled
        - Parametrized construction with all members enabled
        - Ability to calculate Tax for the car as 10 % of price
    
    Bike- 
        - bikeType COMMUTE , OFFROADER OR SPORTS
        - Default construction disabled
        - Copy constructor enabled
        - Parametrized constructor with all members enabled
        - Ability to calculateTax for the Bike as 5% of price


Search what is duck typing and monkey typing C++ and JAVA has monkey typing and Python has duck typing.
Search For SOR sepration of responsibility and also for design pattern

When to USE ENUM :
    For categorial Data that is fixed number of varitied for example:
    Months in a calendar year
    

why to make an abstract class->

----------------------------------------------------DAY 2 ----------------------------------------------------------

search for lifetime of object


We cant Make parametrized constructor by using default keyword
why are you allowed to ass l literal value 10 fo a fucntion 
that accped A rvalue reference to an integer


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Virtual Notes

/*
    Non - Abstract Type Employee
    Manager Extends employee or Manger derives from employee

    Employee:
        CalculateTax():
            10 % of salary
        
    Manager:

        CalculateTax():
            12 % of salary


        V table contains the most derived implementaion of 

        Base class
        Non virtual 1
        [0x100H]
        Non - Virtual 2
        [0x100H]


        If you are upcasting (parent type pointer child type objects)
        -----------------------------------------------------------------

        Rule 1 - for a non virtual function : NO MATTER WHAT IS THE TYPE OF OBJECT
        ALWAYS THE BASE CLASS FUNCTION WILL BE CALLED

        Rule 2 0 For a virtual function ( marked as virtual in base): COMPILER WILL CLL THE
        MOST DERIVED VERSION OF THE FUNCTION i,e IT WILL LOOK IN THE HILD FOR AN OVERRIDEN 
        VERSION OF THE FUNCTION  (Type of object Matters)
