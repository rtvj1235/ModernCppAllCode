    Structured Oriented (imperative coding)-----> HOW TO DO SOMETHING ?:
        Blocks of loging executed in some sequence
        one after the other or asynchronously

    Object Oriented (Object - based / data - driven)
        send/ receive signals for data units created on the basis of model

    Functional Programming (declarative style)----------> WHAT TO DO?
    [THINKING IN TERMS OF FUNCTIONS ALWAYS !!!!]
    


//RULE NO 1:
    Always think like :  APPLY AN OPERATION(FUNCTION) ON DATA!

HOW TO MAKE FUNCTION POINTERS

for example

int square(int number){
    return number * number;
}
int cube (int number){
    return number * number * number;
}
void sum (float a , int b){
    return a+b;
}

int main()
{
    [return type] [Name of ptr] [agruments/parameters] = FUNCTION Name

    int(*ptr1)(int) = square;
    void(*ptr2)(float, int) = sum;
    
}



    some opearion which are possible in a language that fully
    supports Functional style coding !!


    1. Every function has a type
    2. A function can be passed as a parameter to another function
    3. A function can return a function from the body of another function
    4. Address of a fucntion can be stored in a lvalue '
    5. A functions can be stored in data containers

    A function that takes another function as parameter or returns a function 
    is called higher order function
