While reading UML Daigram thing to consider
    - Type of line
    - Type of arrow head
    - Presence or absence of arrow head
    - Direction of the arrow head (Where does the arrow head points)
    - Cardinality (number of 
            class, for example
            (1..*) - it is called as one or more appreances
            (0..*) - zero or more 

        )

    - Dotted line indicates abstraction in UML diagram it means presence of abstraction

    - Basic Aggregation
        an association with an aggregation relationship indicates that one class is a part
        of the another class. in an aggregation relationship the child class instance can outlive
         its parent class To represent an aggregation relationship you draw a solid line from the parent class to the part class and draw an unfilled daimond shape on the parent class's association end.
    
    - Composition Aggregation
        THe composition aggregation relationship is just another from of the aggregation relationship
        but the child class's instance lifecycle is dependent on the parent class instance lifecycle 
        Compostion relationship is drawn like the aggregation relationship but this time the daimond is filled

USE CASE DAIGRAM

    - Oval or cricle inside the daigram denotes the functionalities
    - A solid line that connects actor and functionalities 
        means this functionalities is accessible by this actor 

ACTIVITY DAIGRAM 
    - In UML daigram you can use activity diagrams to model thesequenceof actions that must occur in a
    System or application, or to describe what happens in a busiess process workflow

    Filled oval cricle is starting point of the activity daigram
    - a concentric circle  where the inner circle is filled is called the end of activity

    Activity edge -
        Connects two steps in activity daigram
        a solid line with an arrow (Direction in important)

    SwimLanes in activity daigram
        - SwimLanes are horizontal or vertical lanes in an activity daigram that are used to organize
            and categorize activities based on the role or responsibility of the participent performing

SEQUENCE DAIGRAM -
    The sequence daigram is used primarily to show the 

    The main prupose of a sequence diagram is to define event sequences that result in some desired outcomes
    The foucs is less on message themsleves and more on the order in which message occur neverthless most 
    sequence diagrams will communicate what message are sent between a system object as well as 


    in sequence diagram dotted line with an arrow is return type

    MESSAGE-

        The first message of a sequence diagram always start at the top of and is typically located
        on the left side of the diagram for readibility subsequent messages are then added to the diagram slightly
        lower than the previous message.
        To show an object sending a message to another object you draw a line to'the receiving object
        with a slid arrowhead (if a synchronous call operation) or with a stick arrowhead ( if an asynchronous signal).

    Activation Box-
